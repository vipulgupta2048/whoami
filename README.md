# Whoami

This simple tool allows you to quickly fetch and display information about multiple GitHub users in a tabular format. It's built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and is designed to be hosted on GitHub Pages.

It's a handy tool for quickly checking the GitHub profiles of multiple users.

## Features

*   **Fetches data from the GitHub API:** Retrieves user information such as bio, repository count, orgs, links and more.
*   **Comma-separated input:** Accepts a list of GitHub usernames separated by commas. Outputs a comma seperated list for easier post processing.
*   **Tabular display:** Presents the fetched data in an organized table for easy viewing.
*   **Responsive design:** Adapts to different screen sizes for optimal viewing on various devices.

## Important Notes

*   **GitHub API Rate Limits:** Be mindful of GitHub's API rate limits. If you exceed the limit, your requests might be temporarily blocked. To avoid this, you can use a personal access token with higher rate limits.
*   **Further Development:** This tool can be extended by adding more user-friendly feedback in case of errors, more features such as filtering, sorting, or pagination for the table data.
